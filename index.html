				<h2>Uer Feedback</h2>
        <b>During user test section, I have interviewed 5 users for a general user feedback.</b>
	<!-- this is the start of the interview: text. -->
        <ol>
          <li>
Q: what would you think about this web design?
          </li>
<p>Shirley: I like the simplicity of this design, but except home page, there seems not many picture of other element, a bit boring.</p>

<p>Shirley: I personally think the first image is not appropriate, and this page(about us) you might wanna add little bit design element, it looks like that I am look at a power point or word document.
</p>
<p>Q：ok, is there anything else you would like to say?
Shirley: em, home page does contain quit many information about the charity and plastic pollution, yeah, I would like more design element adding to it such as icons.
</p>

          <li>
Q: what would you think about this web design?
          </li>
<p>Rex: I think the grey color of the navigation bar sort make me uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Q: what color do you think might be right?
</p>
<p>Rex: blue and white text maybe? cause I see most of their clothes are the same color.</p>
<p>Rex: I see a lot of empty space over there (bottom), might be consider adding logo or some thing on it. By the way, two picture here (what’s happening in October) can be bigger.
</p>
 <li>
Q: what do you think about this web design?
          </li>
<p>Jack: Benj, this is way better than I made last year, I nearly made a website that looks like last century. I really like the grey main color of the website. </p>

<p>Jack: and just make the navigation bar, thinner. 
</p>
 <li>
Q: what would you like to say about this web design?
          </li>
<p>White: I quite like it, actually, the color mixed together are consistent and simple at same time. The navigation bar is clear at the moment. There is nothing I could say to improve it.</p>
<li>
Q: what would you like to say about this web design?
LXY: I think there is only few things I think could be better, firstly, the fisrt page, the black box is sort like a pop out window, but you said it is not interactive.
LXY: the buttom of the page can be improved, now its like too heavy at the top, there might be some sort of text or other element at the bottom. yeah, the red cross over the whale can be heavier.
          </li>

<!-- this is the end of the interview-->
<b><center>Conclusion: user feedback</center></b>
<ul>
<li>first empresion need to highlight the topic</li>
<li> need more design element</li>
<li>there are too much empty space at the button of home page </li>
<li>navigation bar need to be thinner</li>
<li>there is no contact information about people work in this orgnization
</ul>
        </ol>

				<h3>Design changes</h3>
 <header><center>Images</center></header>
<figure>
  	<img src="images/homepage.png" alt="development of the home page" width="100%">
			</figure>
      <p>According to user feedback, the original image on the proposal was not identified the topic of plastic ocean. The image on the final prototype is successfully and visually pointed out the topic of plastic pollution to the ocean.
      </p>
<header><center>Icons</center></header>
<img src="images/icon_whale.png" alt="evolution of icon"" width="50%">
<p>During proposal stage, all icons in the home page (statistic section) were pure white, untill I realized colored icons gives more identity about what information I want to delivery. Finally to the last version, which adding a red cross over the whale delivery information of died animal more precise.</p>
<img src="images/help.svg" alt="help icon"" width="10%">
<p>The help icon will be useful when user trying to understand more information about orgninzation's income. However, there is no specific information at the monment, but this small icon will be helpful in the future development.</p>
<header><center>Information</center></header>
<img src="images/aboutus.png" alt="development of information page"" width="100%">
<p>This page has been added to the website after proposal. After user feedback, I added contact information of responsible people and added differenciation element to website link and emial address, and make them clickble as well.</p>

<section id="principle">
				<h5><center>Design patterns and Principles</center></h5>
        <img src="images/home_position.png" alt="design patterns home"" width="100%">
<figcaption>*the design of home page is applied according to the follwing thoery:</figcaption>
<img src="images/golden ritio.png" alt="golden ritio"" width="30%">
	<blockquote>“Golden ratio is contained the fundamental principle of all formation striving to beauty and totality in the realm of nature and in the field of the pictorial arts.”

_ Adolf Zeising</blockquote>
<p> Lindgaard has claimed that the web designers have 50 milliseconds to make a good first impression. (2011) The purpose of the 'first impression' design is to visually grap user's attention and highlight the topic at the same time.(including the use of full image with darked mask, and plenry of the empty space)
   <img src="images/aboutus_position.png" alt="design patterns aboutus"" width="50%">
<figcaption>*the design of the summary section position is applied according to the follwing thoery:</figcaption>
<img src="images/grid.png" alt="grid"" width="30%">
	<p>For summary text, obviously, the page is intended to left-hand place since right margin is wide enought to fit into the background. This is according to the the principle in the Grid System article.(Müller-Brockmann, 2018)</p>
   <img src="images/joinus_position.png" alt="design patterns joinus"" width="100%">
<p>the design of join us section is applied according to the <b>Rule of thirds</b>, a fundenmental but essential principle in the phtography field, which highlight the element in the cross section of the lines.</p>
<section id="reflections">
				<h6><center>Further reflections</center></h6>
      <p>After user feedback, I have made most changes according to them. However, at the current stage, the web can not be perfect, there are still plenty of defects.</p>
      <ul><b>futhure development can be those aspects:</b>
        <li>simplify information on 'about us page', make a sub-section for statistics about orgnization.</li>
        <li>improve mobile website platform, make sure there is't any crush of information and unclear text.</li>
        <li>addign more element and information if neccessary to the bottom of the home page.</li>
        <li>last but not least, improve user experience by finanize user interaction.</li>
